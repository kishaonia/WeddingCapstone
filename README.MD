# Wedding Website Clone
This website clone is a platform dedicated to weddings, providing functionality for managing various aspects of wedding planning such as guestlists, registries, comments, song requests, and photo uploads. Users can register, log in, and update their profiles. This project serves as my capstone project.

# Installation
To install the backend and frontend components, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
Install backend dependencies: npm install
Start the backend server: npm start
Open a new terminal window/tab.
Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend
Install frontend dependencies: npm install
Start the frontend development server: npm start



## After completing these steps, you should have the backend and frontend of the wedding website clone up and running on your local machine. This project showcases my skills and serves as the culmination of my studies in the form of a capstone project.
